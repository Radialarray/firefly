#Firefly - Modern Arcade Game

### Firefly is about a journey through the dark forest and night sky.
It's based on the box2d physics library. You play a small firefly and need to reach the night sky.
On your journey you can collect other fireflies to build a swarm and to gain more vision.

###Have a try and play it.
The controls are *space* to start and restart the game and the *up, down, left, right* cursors for moving.

Don't be confused, the game was initially developed for an upright display, so you have to manually zoom out.
Also only tested on safari.
